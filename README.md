I started my project with scraping problems from Leetcode using beautiful soup and selenium. The code for the same has been mentioned in a ‘Srapping Programms ’ folder 
in the github repository. Using this code, I extracted 2657 problems and named them as ‘lc_problems.txt’, where CNT=1,2,3… 2657. I also saved the problem names and urls
as ‘Qindextxt’ respectively. Next, I used Python to generate ‘idf-values.txt’, ‘vocab.txt’, ‘documents.txt’ and ‘inverted-index.txt’ using the taught algorithm, the codes 
for which have been mentioned in the github repository with appropriate names. Using these text files, I was able to run my app locally. However, after deploying my app 
on render.com I used files app.py and which find the most relevant and route the page to index.html. From here on, all the code was written in html and css where we 
implemente.
